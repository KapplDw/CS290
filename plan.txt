*create login system
*known customers can Order
*known admins can edit menu
*fill up the menu from a .json (like the assign 5)
*create a system where customer logins could add menu items to their Order
*calculate total cost in the order
*templatize pages



plan atm:
- page 1 = static aside from login
- add to order either through on:hover or a button in the box
- hide the button to add menu items unless specific login


check unsplash.com and pexels.com for sprites

freepik is a option too but you need to cite in the code where you got it from
